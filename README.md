# Morgan Creek Website

This is just a backup for the Morgan Creek website. The site is voluntary work
and need to be improved in a lot of areas.
I did the work to gain experience in Web Development and to learn a little
Bootstrap and HTML5 coding along with PHP.
Project date was around May 2016.

## TODO:
- I still need content from Morgan Creek to update on the site
- Improve site SEO
- When I get the chance I will improve the site code.
